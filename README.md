Learning Milestone: Foundations of Cybersecurity
 Milestone Overview

This milestone represents a major shift in my understanding of hacking and cybersecurity.

I once believed hacking meant shortcuts, illegal tricks, and movie-style exploits.
Through structured learning, my perspective completely changed.

I now understand that real cybersecurity begins with fundamentals, ethics, and deep technical knowledge.

 What Changed My Perspective

Hacking is not about tools first

Hacking is about understanding systems

White-hat principles are the starting point

Knowledge comes before exploitation

 Concepts Learned
Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

What white-hat hacking truly means

What bug bounty hunting really involves

Difference between penetration testing and random attacks

 Networking Fundamentals

How computer networks work behind the scenes

Understanding client–server architecture

How data packets travel across a network

How different types of servers function and communicate

Key Realization

This foundational knowledge is what real cybercrime investigators, penetration testers, and security professionals rely on before touching any hacking tool.

Tools don’t create hackers.
Understanding does.
